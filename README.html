<h1 id="jquery-hijax">jQuery Hijax</h1>
<p>Hijax is a jQuery dependant plugin that uses the JavaScript History API in HTML5 and jQuery&#39;s AJAX method to dynamically replace content when new pages are loaded. The plugin works similarly to others such as <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq">jQuery BBQ</a>, <a href="https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/">History.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax">jQuery PJAX</a>. The difference between those plugins and this are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not to alter the URL for its own use. No query strings, no hashtags or fragments are added.</li>
<li>Is progressive enhancement only. No backwards compatibility with browsers that don&#39;t support the History API.</li>
<li>Does not require special headers.</li>
<li>Assumes that it should hook to your <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags.</li>
<li>Only targets a single container.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of Hijax is to simply add the functionality needed in order to easily make a site load pages and switch out content via AJAX while keeping the browser functionality that users expect. It also provides easy access to animating between those states.</p>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>
<p>Load the Hijax script after you load jQuery on your pages and initiate it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-HTML">&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/path-to-source/jquery.hijax.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    jQuery(document).ready(function($) {

        jQuery(document).hijax();

    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s all you need! While the basic use of the script is fairly simple, there are a lot of things that you may need to do to make sure it works as intended. The biggest of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the script loads on all of your pages.</li>
<li>In your template for your pages, make sure there is a consistent area where you&#39;ll be switching out content.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="html">HTML</h4>
<p>Hijax switches content on one page for content in another page from the same area. So, your content on every page should be contained within the same content tag in the page structure. As an example, most sites follow a structure like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-HTML">&lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Navigation, logo, search usually go in here somewhere --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!-- Here is where the actual page content that changes goes --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Footer navigation, copyrights, addresses, etc. --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When loading a new page, usually only the content within #content changes from page to page. This is the tag you would target for Hijax. The default ID Hijax will target is #siteContent (this can be changed in the options).</p>
<h1 id="options">Options</h1>
<p>These are the options currently available for Hijax.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Default</th>
<th>Description</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>element</code></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can use them like the example below: </p>
<pre><code class="lang-Javascript">var Hijax = $.Hijax({
    element: &#39;#my-element&#39;,
    exclude: &#39;.link-exclude&#39;
    ...
});
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Currently, <code>smoothScroll</code> only works for links in the document. It doesn&#39;t animate for <code>popstate</code> events. Instead, the plugin falls back to just snapping the window back to the top.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="animating-pages-in-out">Animating Pages In / Out</h4>
<p>By default, these functions simply proceed to the next phase of loading. However, they are supplied for use that will allow a developer to have multiple functions activate and finish before the actual AJAX load occurs. This is mainly so that you can add your own custom animations to have smooth transitions between pages (but it could be used/abused for other purposes). An example of this is below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-Javascript">var Hijax = $.Hijax({
    sequenceOut: function(callback, data){
        $(&#39;#element&#39;).animate({ opacity: 0 }, { duration: 1000, complete: callback });
    },
    sequenceIn: function(callback, data){
        $(&#39;#element&#39;).animate({ opacity: 1 }, { duration: 1000, complete: callback });    
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>The callback argument and the actual call of the callback are required for the functions to work properly and for an actual page load to occur. The data argument has an object that can help you make decisions on what animation is appropriate. It contains:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Key</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>url</code></td>
<td>object</td>
<td>Lets you know either the previous/next URL and the current URL, depending on the sequence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>element</code></td>
<td>DOM element</td>
<td>The element that made the request happen. A link (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) or the <code>window</code> (for forward/back). Manual <code>load</code> requests are shown as coming from <code>window</code>. (sequenceOut only)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>direction</code></td>
<td>string</td>
<td>Only happens on a <code>popstate</code> event (forward/back buttons are clicked). Lets you know which button was clicked. (sequenceOut only)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="events">Events</h4>
<p>Events have replaced the old loading callbacks. Those callbacks didn&#39;t pass any information and weren&#39;t used much in testing. In addition, all events are now namespaced to Hijax, which should make them easier to unbind, if needed.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Event</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>beforeload.hijax</code></td>
<td>Occurs just before AJAX call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>afterload.hijax</code></td>
<td>When the AJAX call has successfully completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>completeload.hijax</code></td>
<td>After the <code>sequenceIn</code> callback has completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>progress.hijax</code></td>
<td>While the AJAX call is occuring. Useful for a possible loading bar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>samelocation.hijax</code></td>
<td>A special event for clicked links. If the link href is determined to be the current page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>errorload.hijax</code></td>
<td>When the AJAX call fails. This should usually be because the page doesn&#39;t exist.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h5 id="additional-information-about-events">Additional information about Events</h5>
<h6 id="-afterload-hijax-"><code>afterload.hijax</code></h6>
<p>This event will also return the response that was recieved from the AJAX call. You can use this to your advantage if you need to parse the response for additional data. This can be especially helpful for things like switching classes on elements outside the content area.</p>
<h6 id="-errorload-hijax-"><code>errorload.hijax</code></h6>
<p>This event will also return some data to help you determine what you should do in the case of an error. The data returned in the event object is <code>status</code> and <code>statusText</code>. This event does not handle errors for you. There is no default behavior with the plugin for when a resource doesn&#39;t load for whatever reason. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use this event! It is up to the developer to figure out a best course of action (such as alerting the user, trying to make the request again, leading the user to an error page, etc.).</p>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>There are a couple methods for use with Hijax that should help you out in very specific circumstances.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>response</code></td>
<td><code>jQuery(document).hijax(&#39;response&#39;)</code></td>
<td>Returns the last response from the AJAX call that Hijax used. This should be the source code of the last page loaded, if the call succeeded. Useful if you need to extract more data out of it (such as classes, meta information, etc.) that is outside of the content area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>load</code></td>
<td><code>jQuery(document).hijax(&#39;load&#39;, &#39;someurl&#39;)</code></td>
<td>Manually load a page. You must supply a URL string as an argument. If you specify a URL that is external, it is simply a convenience function for <code>window.location.href</code>. The page will not load if it is the same as the current one.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h1>
<h4 id="behavior-with-links">Behavior with Links</h4>
<p>Hijax is meant to take over links in your page by default. It targets all the links except those specified in the <code>exclude</code> option. However, Hijax will also automatically ignore certain links if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a hashtag for the current page (in which case the browser should do its default behavior)</li>
<li>It has a <code>target</code> attribute that points to: &quot;_blank&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;, or &quot;_top&quot;</li>
<li>It has a <code>download</code> attribute (Part of HTML5 spec. The browser should prompt for download - if supported.)</li>
<li>It is an external link (By comparing the host/domain of the current URL and the target, should do default behavior)</li>
<li>It is determined to be the same as the current page (in which case loading is redundant)</li>
</ul>
<p>This should get rid of most undesired behavior with links and UX.</p>
<h4 id="tested-on">Tested On</h4>
<p>Hijax has been tested in these environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome 39+, Safari 8+, Firefox 34+ (OSX)</li>
<li>Safari 8+ (iOS 8+)*</li>
<li>Chrome 39+ (Android 4.1+)</li>
<li>IE10+, Edge 12+ (Windows 8+)</li>
</ul>
<p>Support is most likely as wide as shown here <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=history">http://caniuse.com/#search=history</a>, but hasn&#39;t been tested with all the browsers that show support on that list. Browsers that are cross-platform likely work in any environment they&#39;ve been made for.</p>
<p>*Note: iOS was tested in simulator.</p>
